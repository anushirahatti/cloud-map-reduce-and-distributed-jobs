Distributed Image Processing on Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Dataproc.

#### Description:
Used Apache Spark on Cloud Dataproc to distribute a computationally intensive image processing task onto a cluster of machines.

#### Steps:
1. Created a development machine in Compute Engine.
2. Installed software on that machine.
3. Created a Google Cloud Storage Bucket and collected images.
4. Created a Cloud Dataproc cluster.
5. Submitted jobs to Cloud Dataproc.
